      • Codebreaker is a logic game in which a code-breaker tries to break a secret code created by a code-maker. The codemaker, which will be played by the codebreaker_vk we’re going to write, creates a secret code of four numbers between 1 and 6.\n
      • The codebreaker gets some number of chances to break the code (depends on chosen difficulty). In each turn, the codebreaker makes a guess of 4 numbers. The codemaker then marks the guess with up to 4 signs - + or - or empty spaces.\n
      • A + indicates an exact match - one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code and in the same position. For example\n
        Secret number - 1234\n
        Input number - 6264\n
        Number of pluses - 2 (second and fourth position)\n
      • A - indicates a number match - one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code but in a different position. For example\n
        Secret number - 1234\n
        Input number - 6462\n
        Number of minuses - 2 (second and fourth position)\n
      • An empty space indicates that there is not a current digit in a secret number.\n
      • If codebreaker inputs the exact number as a secret number - codebreaker wins the game. If all attempts are spent - codebreaker loses.\n
      • Codebreaker also has some number of hints(depends on chosen difficulty). If a user takes a hint - he receives back a separate digit of the secret code.\n"
