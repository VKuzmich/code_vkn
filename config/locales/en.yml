          # Codebreaker is a logic game in which a code-breaker tries to break a secret code created by a code-maker. The\n codemaker, which will be played by the application weâ€™re going to write, creates a secret code of four numbers between\n 1 and 6.\n
          # The codebreaker gets some number of chances to break the code (depends on chosen difficulty). In each turn, the\n codebreaker makes a guess of 4 numbers. The codemaker then marks the guess with up to 4 signs - + or - or empty\n spaces.\n
          # A + indicates an exact match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code\n and in the same position. For example:\n
          Secret number - 1234\n
          Input number - 6264\n
          Number of pluses - 2 (second and fourth position)\n
          # A - indicates a number match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code\n but in a different position. For example:\n
          Secret number - 1234\n
          Input number - 6462\n
          Number of minuses - 2 (second and fourth position)\n
          # An empty space indicates that there is not a current digit in a secret number.\n
          # If codebreaker inputs the exact number as a secret number - codebreaker wins the game. If all attempts are spent -\n codebreaker loses.\n
          # Codebreaker also has some number of hints(depends on chosen difficulty). If a user takes a hint - he receives back a\n
          separate digit of the secret code.\n"
